            <h3>What is the difference between localStorage and session Storage ?</h3>
            <div>
                <h5>sessionStorage:</h5>
                <li>sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the
                    duration
                    of the page session</li>
                <li>Stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser is closed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Storage limit is larger than a cookie.
                </li>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>localStorage:</h5>
                <li>localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.</li>
                <li>Stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the
                    Browser
                    cache / Locally Stored Data.</li>
                <li>Storage limit is the maximum amongst the two.</li>

            <h3>What is the difference between global and block scope?</h3>
            <div>
                <h5>Block scope:</h5>
                <p>ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.These two keywords provide Block
                    Scope in JavaScript.Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h5>Global scope:</h5>
                <p>A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.A global variable has Global Scope.Global
                    variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How to work javaScript event loop?</h3>
            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>how we can get undefiend in javaScript?</h3>
            <p>The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.
